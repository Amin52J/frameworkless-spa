# Frameworkless-SPA

A frameworkless single page application boilerplate. [**LIVE DEMO**](http://www.amin52j.com)

You can read more about the idea, theory and the implementation of this boilerplate on [**this article**](https://medium.com/@a.jafari.90/framework-less-single-page-application-a547325f6e0c).

### Benefits

* **Super lightweight:** Only 1.2 KB gzipped Javascript overhead.
* **SEO Friendly:** 100% SEO friendly with SSR.
* **Easy to use:** Nothing more than the old HTML and CSS development that we all first started from.
* **Full control:** Using this boilerplate and/or terminology we have full control over what and how we wanna implement things and what technologies and environments we wanna work with.
* **High performance:** Nothing beats the power and performance of Vanilla JS, HTML and CSS.
* **Extendible:** You can easily twist and extend this boilerplate and/or terminology to any extent that your mind and needs go.
* **File System Routing:** 100% file system routing support for all your pages and scripts.

### Technologies

* **babel:** to transpile our ES6-7
* **cssnano:** to not worry about the prefixes and css code performance
* **eslint:** to have linting utility over our code
* **express:** to get our server up and running (can be replaced by any backend languages or technologies)
* **mustache:** as our html template generator (can be replaced by any templating systems for any languages)
* **prettier:** to apply linting to our code before commits
* **SCSS:** to style our project
* **webpack:** as our module bundler
